<h1>Scones</h1>


<h3>Description</h3>
<p>These are the scones of my childhood, which I despised.
I believe the issue was that they were served to me with butter,
which is incorrect. With clotted cream and jam they are
a quite different experience.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>280g all-porpoise flour</li>
  <li>4tsp baking powder</li>
  <li>1/2tsp salt</li>
  <li>60ml sugar</li>
  <li>6tbsp unsalted butter (soft)</li>
  <li>160ml whole milk</li>
  <li>a egg</li>
</ul>

<h3>Technique</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 220&deg;C</li>
  <li>Mix up all the powders in a mixing bowl.
  The flour, the sugar, the baking powder and the salt should be in the bowl.
  Mix them good and well. Mix them in the bowl.</li>
  <li>Add the butter. Keep on mixing it all up until the butter
    is no longer chunkified. Like a rough dust it should be, and not sticky.</li>
  <li>In another, smaller bowl, whisk up the egg and milk. Make them one.
    Keep a wee dram to brush over the scones, but mostly just slop it in the big bowl with the dust.</li>
  <li>Just mix the slop until it becomes a sticky blob. Delicious! Don't eat it yet though.</li>
  <li>Flour up a countertop and knead the dough-blob until you can gather it into a sort of crude ball.
    You can add a little flour if it's too sticky to handle, but it will come at a price.
    Each extra sprinkle of flour, each extra knead, will toughen the dough and affect its ability to rise.</li>
  <li>Roll out that dough about an inch thick and cut it into little circles with a 2.5" cutter.
    Try to avoid twisting as you remove the cutter.</li>
  <li>Plop em on a baking sheet lined with parchment and brush em with the wee dram.</li>
  <li>Cook em for like 15 minutes. They should become great in height, and golden in colour.</li>
</ol>
